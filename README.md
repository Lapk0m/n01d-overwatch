```

Real-time Middle East and Global Conflict Intelligence Dashboard.
OSINT aggregation, flight tracking, maritime awareness, war ops monitoring, missile defense mapping, equipment order of battle, warzone radio streams, and eclipse warfare analysis.

**No API keys required.** Uses publicly available OSINT feeds and the OpenSky Network.

## What is N01D Overwatch?

A Windows desktop intelligence dashboard that aggregates open-source intelligence (OSINT) from dozens of real-time sources into a single unified command interface. Built for researchers, analysts, journalists, and anyone tracking geopolitical events in conflict zones.

Think of it as a personal situation awareness terminal — pulling live data from RSS feeds, flight trackers, ship transponders, missile site databases, equipment deployments, warzone press radio streams, and war operations monitoring — all rendered on an interactive dark-themed map with XChat IRC aesthetics.
